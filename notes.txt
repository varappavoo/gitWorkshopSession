git status
 	tells us the status of the working directory
 	###

.gitignore 
	a file in your git folder that is created to contain all file that will be ignored by git
	* 	echo passwords.txt > .gitignore
 	*	.gitignore contains files that will be ignored by git

	###
	After modifying a file:
	[do a git status]
	do a git add...
	[do a git status]
	do a git commit
	###

git commit
 	commit the changes that were made
 	the chosen editor will pop up to allow you to add a comment for this commit
 	###
	Commit messages:
	Present tense
	Why is this necessary
	50/72 rules - message description between 50 and 70 chars
	###
 	###
	Commits path:
	1. Working directory - directory where one is working with all files
	2. Staging area - after a git add, not yet committed
	3. Repository - after committing from a staging area
	###
	NB Modifications made after a staging are not part of the commit
	###

git log
 	shows us all the commit that were made

git log --oneline
	shows us a summary of the git commit history

git diff old new
	shows us the change between two commits

git diff
	shows us the differences between the Staging area and Working directory

git add -p
	patch mode - let selectively stage the change

### to be used carefully
git reset --hard
	clean the working directory to match what the repository
	useful after a patching 

### move across time
git checkout [branch name/commit_hash/etc] # that's HEAD
	switches to that branch/commit/etc
	# HEAD is a pointer that points to what version your are currently viewing

### to get back to the actual time
git checkout master

git revert branch name/commit_hash/etc
	Commit master to a previously saved state

### Branches - parallel universes where we can work on different things in isolation
git branch
	give a list of all branches in the repository
	show you yo which brach you are currently working

git branch [branch name]
	create a new branch
	use checkout to switch to the new branch

### Merge - merge changes made by another branch into the current one, we use:
git merge [branch name]
	merge changes on [branch] to master

git remote add origin [uri]
	add a git remote with the name origin
	git remote add origin https://github.com/varappavoo/fvs.git
 
Followed by a push
	git push -u origin master
	
Update remote repo
git push [remote] [branch]
	git push -u origin master

git pull [remote] [branch]
e.g. git pull origin master
	pull repo from master - commit and pus

git clone [url]
	Clone git repository from remote url
